 I made a somewhat large blunder. This is the first time I have programmed in c++, and it went {\bfseries{very}} {\bfseries{very}} badly. I had working Node and Edge objects early on. With those, I had expected the Aho Corasick Trie functions to be somewhat straight forward to implement. However, in doing so, I ran into issues with pointers that I wasn\textquotesingle{}t able to resolve. ~\newline


For what it is worth, learning how to write {\bfseries{formal}} tests, and create {\bfseries{formal}} documentation is important to me. I have not written a single line of c++ prior to this assignment, and have not used googletests (the test suite) or Doxygen (the documentation generator) before, either. What the formality is telling me right now is that I have an enormous misunderstanding of namespace and object life cycle that I need to resolve quite quickly. ~\newline

At the top, you\textquotesingle{}ll notice a navigator bar. More or less, clicking any of the drop downs will bring you to an interface where you can view the objects and their documentation. ~\newline


The header file implements the Node and Edge objects, and describes an interface for the Aho Corasick Trie. The .cpp file implements the interface, and this is where my attempts at the Trie algorithms are. As of this writing, those algorithms aren\textquotesingle{}t working due to pointer/object life cycles. ~\newline


If possible, I\textquotesingle{}d appreciate some more time to try to get this right. I want to learn how to do this in C++, and I\textquotesingle{}d like to learn how to do it well.
