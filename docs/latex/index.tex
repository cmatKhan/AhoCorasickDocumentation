 It works! This is the first time I have coded in c++, or used pointers directly. I am still learning about how to to deal with autoconf and whatnot. This compiles on my computer, running ubuntu 20.\+04 and g++ version 9.\+3.\+0.

There is a test suite which is implemented with googletests. There code is 100\% covered by the tests. Documentation is created from appropriately formatted comments by Doxygen.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{How to use this site}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
At the top, you\textquotesingle{}ll notice a navigator bar. More or less, clicking any of the drop downs will bring you to a page where you can navigate to the object definitions. But, the most interesting is Classes-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}Class List. Click on \mbox{\hyperlink{classACTrie}{ACTrie}}, which is my implementation of Aho Corasick. The code for the functions \mbox{\hyperlink{classACTrie_ad6aa4730ba51cf2ebbb0992271a58fae}{ACTrie\+::insert()}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classACTrie_a6e6c527e9b1664903267c1ddcd915223}{ACTrie\+::find\+Nv()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{classACTrie_a2343de45b49c8b05a85d8077b97951c3}{ACTrie\+::search()}} is included in the documentation, in addition to a description of the input/output.

\mbox{\hyperlink{aho__corasick_8h_source}{aho\+\_\+corasick.\+h}} implements the Node and Edge objects, and describes an interface for the Aho Corasick Trie. The aho\+\_\+corasick.\+cpp file implements the interface and includes the main method. aho\+\_\+corasick.\+test.\+cpp is the test suite (note that I comment out the main method of the .cpp file to run this. Not great, but I\textquotesingle{}m still learning how to deal with the compiling, etc.)

Once compiled, run the code like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./aho\_corasick pattern\_file.txt target.fa}

\end{DoxyCode}


Output will look like this ({\bfseries{NOTE}} this is not the output of the assignment files, only a short test)\+:
